## **Dependencies and Installation Instructions**

This monorepo contains both the frontend and backend for the **Daily Reflection Journal** app. To get started, follow these instructions:

### **Backend Setup**

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the `.env` file by creating a new file named `.env` in the `server` folder and adding the following:

   ```
   DB_URI=sqlite://db.sqlite
   JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
   PORT=3007
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

This will start the backend API server at `http://localhost:3007`.

### **Frontend Setup**

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd daily-reflection-client
   ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend app:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will start the Expo development server. You can scan the QR code with the Expo Go app or run it on a simulator/emulator:

   ```bash
   npm run ios   # For iOS simulators
   npm run android  # For Android emulators
   ```

## **Application Architecture**

The **Daily Reflection Journal** app is divided into two main sections: the backend and the frontend.

### **Backend Architecture**

- **Express.js** is used to handle API requests.
- **SQLite** is used as the database for storing user data, journal entries, and settings.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** is used for user authentication and secure access to the app.
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware is used for logging requests, validating input, and handling token authentication.
- **Controllers and Routes**: Each major feature of the app (e.g., users, entries, settings) has its own set of routes and controllers.

### **Frontend Architecture**

- **React Native** is used to build a cross-platform mobile app for iOS and Android.
- **Expo** is used for rapid development and testing.
- **React Navigation** handles the navigation between app screens.
- **Context API** is used for global state management (authentication, font size, and theme).
- **Axios** is used to make API calls from the frontend to the backend.
